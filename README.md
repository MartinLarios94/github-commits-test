## Review
- When the app load the first time, create automatically a ```key``` called ```users``` in the ```localStorage```, this key contains an userName, in this case is my gitHub userName: ```MartinLarios94```.

- In the NavBar there is a button called ```Settings``` and the user will be able to add more GitHub Users, the userName ```MUST BE THE EXACTLY GITHUB USERNAME```, then the app load automatically the info of each user registered.

- When the user clicks on any card, he/she will be redirected to all the information of the selected user's repositories.

- In the last column of the table the user will be able to click on the column and then will be redirected to all the repository's commits.


## Netlify
- I deployed the app on Netlify.
